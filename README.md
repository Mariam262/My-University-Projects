### üåü Semester 3 

‚óº **Project Name:** MFAS-An Online Shopping System

‚óºÔ∏è **Description:** MFAS-An Online Shopping System is a software requirements specification (SRS) that describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. It also describes the functionality the product needs to fulfill the needs of all stakeholders (business, users).
The elements that comprise an SRS are
    
1. Define the Problem Statement and Product's Purpose
2. Design Buisness Models
3. Detail the Functional Requirements in Vision Document
4. Design Use-Case Diagram in Use-Case Modelling
5. Requirements traceability matrix
6. Define the Test Cases
7. Elaborate the non functional requiremenst in Supplementary Specification Document

üöÄ An SRS gives you a complete picture of your entire project.It provides a single source of truth that every team involved in development will follow.

## üåü Semester 4

‚óº **Project Name:** Knock & Groce Online Grocery Delivering System

‚óº **Description:** A project on the Human-Computer Interaction subject which consists of the following stages,

1.	Discovery
	* Conduct user interviews
	* Conduct user surveys
	* Develop personae 
2.	Define
	* Develop the information architecture
 	* Develop user flows and scenarios
3.	Ideation
	* Develop low fidelity prototypes in the form of handmade storyboards
	* Make user-system sketches
4.	Prototype 
	* Develop mid-fidelity prototypes in the form of wireframes 
5.	Validation
  	* Perform usability testing 
 	* Comprehension testing
	* Affinity Mapping
6.	User Interfacing
	* Apply mood boards and style guides
  	* Develop High fidelity prototypes of your system

‚óº **Tools:** The mid-fidelity prototypes i.e wireframes and High fidelity prototypes are designed using Figma tool.Here is the link of tool ‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://figma.io/ ‚óÄÔ∏è

üöÄ User interface design is a crucial aspect of software engineering, as it is the means by which users interact with software applications.

## üåü Semester 5

‚óº  **Project Name 1 :** Android Studio Project

‚óº **Description:**  A mobile application project - Ice Cream Parlor to make it easier for customers to order online.It entails searching online and landing on a website that offers customers services that allow them to add multiple ice creams to their carts. They can also adjust the quantities when they choose the ice cream they desire. 

‚óº **Installation:** Install Android Studio in your computers from here ‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://developer.android.com/studio ‚óÄÔ∏è and then run this project. Ensure that Gradle and SDK sync with your Android Studio SDK version if not then update the Android Studio.

‚óº  **Project Name 2 :** Delico - A Cafe Management System

‚óº **Description:**  When your system's software requirements specification (SRS) and designing user interfaces for web or mobile application are ready the next steps comes  under the Software Construction & Development subject in which we have to construct, develop and model the diagrams related to project such as,

1. Use-Case Modelling
2. Activity Diagram
3. Domain Model
4. Class Diagram
5. Sequence Diagram
6. State Transition Diagram

 üöÄ Software diagrams visually represent software components, relationships, and system interactions. They document, analyze, and communicate software design and are used to make decisions on implementation.
